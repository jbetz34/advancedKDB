Inside scripts.q there are 3 defined functions that will perform in nearly the same way. 
They each have their aasumptions about the dataset being passed as input, but given the 
input that was presented in the original problem, raze 500000#enlist("2010.01.01";2010.01.02), 
they return the same output. 
There is an additional function in script.q, compare[func;arg] which will take a defined function 
or a list of defined functions as a symbol/symbol list and an arguement to be passed to the
functions. This function will return a table with columns:
	function (symbol) - function name 
	time (long) - time function took to run in ms
	size (long) - memory used to run func in bytes
	match (boolean) - func output match StringtoDate output
The exact time performance varies for each function from run to run, but the general trend shows
about 1/3 time taken to run. However the cost of this time improvement comes in memory usage. 
Every function developed consistently uses more memory than the default StringtoDate function.
