Question: "In your current system you have a historical database and a single hdb kdb+ instance to host user queries.
	 Users are complaining about slowness. What is the probable cause of the slowness and suggest 2 changes that 
	 could be made to alleviate the problem. Maintain a single entry point to the system if possible."

Answer: Likely the root of the cause here are other queries that hogging system resources. There are a couple options to 
	speed up the user queries. The first option is to create a second hdb kdb+ instance and a gateway to distribute 
	queries across the two instances. This way you would maintain a single entry point for users and you could 
	concurrently run two user queries. Users may still find this too slow, in which case you can still expand 
	horizontally and create more kdb+ instances and configure them within the gateway. 
	A second option would be to limit the free form queries allowed on the kdb+ instance, forcing users to use
	optimized preset queries. Users may not be particularly fond of this option as it will limit their ability to 
	form their own queries, but using this option you can be sure that users queries are optimized and are not going
	to stall the process.
